# Time-Series-Analysis:Stock-Prices-Prediction

In this notebook we perfom a time series analysis of the prices of the german fund (https://fundsus.dws.com/us/en-us/products/closed-end-funds/the-new-germany-fund-inc.html). We use the moving averege, exponential smoothing and double exponential smoothing to identify trends in the stock prices.
The following libraries were used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
